## ❓ What is an NFT in concrete terms?

💠 It is simply a digital token bound by a contract of authenticity, a non-tangible asset that has its own value and its own owner.

💠 They use Blockchain technology, the most famous of which are: Ethereum, Polygon, Solana...&#x20;

💠 The latter is purchased via cryptocurrency on platforms that are called Marketplace like Gardenlab, for example, and which are distinguished into 2 categories:

### 🎨  1. Those without benefits, from the art:

An NFT can be simply an artistic creation, as one could compare it to a painting or a sculpture. It gains or loses value depending on who created it, how famous it is, etc.&#x20;

{% hint style="success" %}
The most famous in the field are the Cryptopunks.
{% endhint %}

### 🎫  2. Those with advantage(s), utilities:

An NFT is an exchangeable asset that allows, thanks to the blockchain and its principle of transparency, to provide benefits to holders in real time such as:

💠 An access to IRL events (boat party, concert place etc...)&#x20;

💠 An automated passive income system in cryptocurrency&#x20;

💠 The possibility to receive NFTs&#x20;

💠 And many more...\

As you can see, the possibilities are endless and only need to be found and developed. The benefits can be numerous, even unlimited and invaluable.

Well, anyone can turn an illustration into an NFT, no coding knowledge is needed. Only your imagination and creativity are good assets.&#x20;

### ✅  What are the advantages for the creator?

Thanks to the blockchain and its principle of transparency you can:&#x20;

💠 Each NFT has an ID and a holder, which allows you to anonymously and freely manage benefits without having to contact the holder.

💠 Offer or not offer benefits even if the NFT gets traded.&#x20;

💠 Management of Smarts Contracts (Smart Contracts) that allow you to remove all intermediaries by automating actions and/or conditions.&#x20;

💠 Each NFT has an ID and a holder, which allows you to manage benefits anonymously and freely without having to contact the holder.
