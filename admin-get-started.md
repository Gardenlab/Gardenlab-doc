## Gardenlab in a Few Words

👋🏻 Welcome to the introduction page of Gardenlab!

We offer tools for administering collections of NFTs (NFT membership card, QR code, CRM, blockchain technology, etc.) to speed up customer engagement and create your exclusive community.

## Creating Your Account, Program, and Collections

To create your account, simply log in to the Gardenlab platform for the first time... and voila, you're done!

You can log in with a crypto wallet (cryptowallet) like Metamask or simply with your email address. Convenient and secure, registration and login take a maximum of 20 seconds.

Creating your program and NFT collections will initially go through our services. We will initialize your collection and then you can modify it as you wish: brand images, name, number of membership cards, description, links to networks, etc.

## Define Your Club Card Benefits and Access

Once the collection of membership cards and the program are defined together, let's move on to gamification.

First, define the conditions of use and "evolution" of your cards, the benefits and their access and unlocking methods, the first customer journey/scans, etc.

Then, using Gardenlab tools, you can configure them simply.

The information will then be on the NFT page of the holders.

⛓️ We even integrate partners from the WEB3 ecosystem to expand the possibilities of benefits and rewards applicable to club card holders.

## Managing Your Interaction with QR Codes

Accessible and easy to use: the QR code!

To evolve a membership card, simply generate a QR code for the program directly from the Gardenlab application. Similarly, to take advantage of a reward, the application provides the user with a unique QR code that will offer its holder a personalized advantage, included in the program.

🔒 In addition to the QR code, a textual password can also be generated to allow cardholders to apply the interaction to their card

📷 The interaction can be applied by the holder themselves, by scanning the generated QR code, but not only... it can also be applied by an administrator by scanning the holder's NFT!

## Use Customer Data to Personalize/Gamify Your Benefits and Track Your Customer Journey (According to CRM)

Using Gardenlab also means easy and quick access to statistics from your collection, in other words, customer data. These key information offer the possibility of creating a personalized customer journey as well as benefits and rewards that precisely meet customers' expectations and desires.

🤖 It even seems that artificial intelligence will be natively integrated into Gardenlab for more personalization, suggestions, and automation.
