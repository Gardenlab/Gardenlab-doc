### Blockchain

Polygon defines itself as "A decentralized platform on Ethereum that enables developers to create easy-to-use and scalable digital applications with low transaction costs, without ever sacrificing security." Gardenlab uses the Polygon blockchain to design and run its smart contracts.

### Consensus protocol

Polygon uses the "Proof-Of-Stake" protocol to validate transactions on its blockchain. This method avoids the use of graphics processors, and focuses on the ability to hold and lock a large number of tokens in what is known as a node. In a Proof of Stake system, the creator of the next block is determined by a random system that is, in part, dictated by how much crypto-currency a user holds or, in some cases, how long they have held that particular currency. The randomness in a PoS system prevents centralization, otherwise the richest individual in the system would always create the next block and constantly increase their wealth and therefore their control of the system. The main advantage of PoS, compared to a system such as PoW, is that it consumes considerably less energy and is therefore more cost effective.

### Scalability

Thanks to Polygon's network, Gardenlab has the ability to benefit from unparalleled scalability. The Polygon network offers the possibility to manage a very large number of transactions per second, which allows to generate a proof of stake and thus, to validate a transaction in a few seconds. The advantage of such scalability is that it offers users extremely low transaction fees and increased transaction speed.

### Smart-contracts

Gardenlab uses its own smart contracts and designs them for its customers. Gardenlab's main contract is the one that allows the purchase and resale of NFT for free on the marketplace. This contract was developed using the core language of the Ethereum blockchain: Solidity. The contract uses EVM to operate by recording transactions in the Polygon blockchain. Gardenlab's smart contracts are open-source and are searchable directly on the Polygon explorer.
